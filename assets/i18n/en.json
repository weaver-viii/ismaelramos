  "infoContent": "Front end full time and full stack developer the time that I have left. In my personal projects I'm in charge of both parties, although I've always liked the front more. I studied computer science and completed it, because I had to, with a two-year web engineering master. I have experience in consultancy and in startups (I love them). At work I like freaky environments, being able to telework from time to time and have some flexibility with the schedules. I consider myself proactive, constantly learning and hardworking. I've been creating and changing websites for about 5 years. <br> Little by little. Pixel to pixel.",
